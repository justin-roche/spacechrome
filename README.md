Spacemacs interface for Chrome

This is a chrome-specific fork of MenuHammer: https://github.com/FryJay/MenuHammer

It adds menus and actions for controlling Chrome devTools. It also adds:

(1) support for minor modes, accessed via ",". Each minor mode is associated with a devTools panel.
(2) an enterFunction, run on each submenu when it is opened
